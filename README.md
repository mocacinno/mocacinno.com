go version of mocacinno.com

Currently in pre-alpha stage... Defenately NOT production ready!!!

You're free to patch anything you'd like and create pull requests in case you want added functionality at an increased pace.

The code is free, if you have your own node running and want a quick and easy gui, don't hesistate to use the code... It should be OK to run out of the box (after updating the config.ini), but maybe it's a good idear to modify the layout.html :)

BTW: i'd still like to be mentioned in the credits (maybe a link to mocacinno.com) in case you run my code... And if you run it for profit, a tip to my tipjar would certainly be appreciated...
